QA Project for Support Integrations


***INTEGRATIONS QA***

<h1>DRAFT</h1>

First thing you should do: 

```git clone``` this repo to your local machine

Second: 

```git branch "<yourname>-dev"``` this will create a new branch from master specifically for you.

```git checkout "branch name"``` Checks our your newly created branch

<p>This will start you from the end of video 2 on the python QA automation series from Carlos<br>When your up to date with you commits and want to merge to master, we can get together and merge to the most up to date code then all pull from master.</p>

***Please reach out to me with any questions!***
